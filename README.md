# NoobGPT
ðŸ¤– NoobGPT â€“ A beginner-friendly AI chatbot built in QBasic, designed to simulate human-like conversations. A fun and nostalgic take on creating simple AI with classic programming tools.


This is a console-based GUI chatbot developed using the QBASIC language when I was in 10th grade (around the year 2080 B.S. / 2023 A.D.). Itâ€™s a simple AI chatbot that learns based on the data you provide.

How to Run the Chatbot Follow these steps to run the chatbot on your system:

Install QB64 Download and install QB64 (a modern version of QBASIC) from a trusted source.

Load the Code Copy the full code (around 100 lines) into the QB64 environment.

Run the Program Execute the program. It will automatically create the required database files.

Train the Chatbot From the program's output console, go to the Manage Database section. Enter questions and their corresponding answers to train the chatbot. The more data you feed, the better the chatbot will perform.

Start Chatting After training, you can chat with the Nepali AI chatbot and enjoy the conversation!
